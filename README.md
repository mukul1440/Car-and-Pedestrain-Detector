# Real Time Car and Pedestrain Detector Using Haar Cascsade Classifier
Computer Vision Plays a vital role in traffic management and surveillance systems and has been an active research area in the past years. In systems like these, the detection of vehicles and also classification of the vehicle plays a major role. The datasets is  video from dashboard of a bike rider  which were used to train the classifier hence generating a robust classifier. The proposed approach is computationally less expensive with faster processing speed. The experiments on-road prove it to be a robust and real time algorithm which is highly competitive with the existing architecture.

This System has the following Haar Cascades:

1)Haar Cascade for Car detection.
2)Haar Cascade for pedestrain detection.

The result of the model are shown below:
